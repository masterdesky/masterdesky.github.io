<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<div class="index-content">
  This is my webpage, which is currently heavily under construction. 
  <p>
    Also, I made $\LaTeX$ working. Watch this:
    $$\left( \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \Delta + \hat{V} \right) \Psi \left( \boldsymbol{\hat{r}} \right) = E \Psi \left( \boldsymbol{\hat{r}} \right)$$

  You can find interesting things currently only under the <a href="/blog">Posts</a> menu.
