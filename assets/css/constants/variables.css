One can benefit from using a lineal typeface in headlines in content
written exclusively using Roman fonts. The reason for this, that however
it breaks consistency, headlins will still stick out a bit more which
helps readablity. Henceforth I'm using Helvetical for titles throughout
the website for titles and headlines.
