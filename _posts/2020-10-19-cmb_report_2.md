In this second report of the course Data Science Laboratory, I'm summarizing my work on the data preparation and visualization of real CMB measurement made by the Planck space observatory between 2009 and 2013. I'll also detail the theoretical background and my work on the recreation of the angular power spectrum of the CMB, using the same data.

## Introduction
In this course I'm studying the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation this year. In my project I'm ought to analyze the simulation aspect of it, as well as I'm processing real observational data of the CMB, made by the Planck space observatory. My two main goals are to replicate the CMB temperature map using an arbitrary angular power spectrum, and to extract the power spectrum from real observational data. In this report I would like to summarize my weekly progress in the latter topic, the power spectrum reconstruction. Starting off with a chronological summary, we can place the subject better in time, and understand why we should use the Planck observations.

The existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation was first confidently predicted in 1948 by Ralph Almer, who was working with Robert Herman and George Gamow that time <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>. Non-thermal radiation was considered already half a century earlier, also even the CMB itself was detected (but not correctly interpreted) in the interstellar medium as a component of molecular lines from the lowest state of CH and CN molecules, by Andrew McKellar in 1941 <a href="#cite1">[2]</a>. The phenomenon remained a fairly unpopular topic among astronomers until the early-mid '60s, when numerous individual observations related to the CMB came to light in a very short period of time. Most notably the first real observation of CMB radiation itself by Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilkinson in 1965. Interest was only heightened by the fact that the measurement results were consistent with previous theoretical assumptions <a href="#cite3">[3]</a>

Until the early '70s a scientific consensus was slowly established to declare that the CMB is the remnant of the Big Bang. It was mostly backed by the observations, that the frequency range of this radiation corresponds exactly to the well-known black body radiation <a href="#cite4">[4]</a>. In 1974 NASA issued a tender (or a so-called <it>Announcement of Opportunity</it>) for spacecraft missions to study the CMB radiation from outside Earth's atmosphere. Since then, in these past 40 years, there were 3 notable spacecrafts of NASA (Russia also had one called ), which created complete sky maps of the CMB radiation. Each of them was much more and more detailed, than their predecessor.

The last observations from space was done by the Planck space observatory between 2009 and 2013, succeeding the mission of the WMAP telescope and currently the most detailed datasets of the CMB originates from this telescope. Its mission was followed by 3 major data releases in 2013, 2015 and 2018. The main goal was simple: Measuring the intensity and polarization of the CMB radiation within the entire sky with unprecedented accuracy. For this particular job, the telescope was mounted with two distinct instruments to detect the CMB photons. One for the lower end of the frequency range and one for the higher frequencies. These two instruments mapped the whole sky on 9 different observation frequencies in the GHz domain between 100 and 900 Ghzs. Since these measurements are very noisy, and the CMB itself is completely obscured by foreground radiation, different filtering pipelines was utilized to separate the CMB from the foreground effects to finally create the image of the CMB map as we all know it.

## Dataset

## Theoretical background

## Processing the data

## Results

## Further work
My very next goal will be to tidy up all my codes I've written until now. Since the pipeline is ready to simulate CMB maps, also to process observational data, I can begin to work on the goals, which I set for myself as optional/extra tasks. The first is to try to determine cosmological parameters from the CMB maps, since this is one of the main point of its observation from the beginning. The second optional task would be to create CMB maps on a Mollweide projection without distortions, for which the HEALPix standard proves as a really useful tool.
