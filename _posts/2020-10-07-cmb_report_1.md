This is my first report for the course "Data Science Laboratory" in the second semester in 2020-2021 on ELTE. In this article, I will briefly summarize all the relevant information about my semester project and then detail my work so far on it.
</b>

## I. Introduction
As an MSc Physics student on ELTE enrolled in the Data Science specialization, we need to pass the mandatory course called "Data Science Laboratory". The exact goals of the course are meticulously articulated in the subject’s [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdam-elte/dslab2020) as <i>"...to instill the practical skills needed for exploratory data analysis. With the acquired knowledge the student shall be able to perform independent research requiring the handling of big data."</i>

At the beginning of the semester each student must select a task from a list of existing projects and make reports and oral presentations about the topic every other week. I've chosen the task involving work with the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (or CMB for short), which I need to study both from the computer simulation and the data analysis side.

## II. Theoretical background
### II./1. Basics of the CMB
Even those with basic interest and knowledge in astronomy have heard of the CMB probably, at least on an elementary level. The notority of this phenomenon implies it correctly, that it is an obviously actively studied field in astronomy. The reason is that the CMB has an essential role in the understanding of fundamental questions and topics in physics. It is used eg. to determine cosmological parameters or to better understand the events following the Big Bang.

In its core nature CMB is an immensely redshifted black-body radiation with average colour temperature of $2.725$ K. By saying "CMB" we actually refer to the collection of those photons, which was created in the Big Bang and thus already existed during the recombination period of the universe. For a long period, the universe was opaque. Photons created in the Big Bang constantly scattered on electrons in this very dense and hot so-called "gas-universe". After approximately $370\,000$ years after the Big Bang the universe cooled to a point (to $\approx 3000$ K), where the formation of hydrogen atoms was energetically favorable. We say, that at this point the existing photons "decoupled from the matter" (they stopped being constantly scattered on electrons), their mean free path increased by an intangible extent, they stopped being in constant thermodynamical equilibrium with free electrons and the universe become electromagnetically transparent. Due to the expansion of the universe since then, the originally $3000$ K hot CMB photons redshifted by a factor of $z = 1100$ to the already mentioned $2.725$ K, which we observe today. These photons travel through space since the era of the recombination. Looking at the sky, the light of the CMB reaches us from all direction at the same time. Effectively, we see this light coming to us from a very distant shperical shell sorrunding us, while we're sitting in the middle. Since this shell represents the place of origin of the CMB at the time of the recombination event, we call this as the "Last Scattering Surface" (or LSS for short).  
This radiation carries cardinal information about the cosmology of the universe. First the primordial fluctuations of the universe imprinted into its structure (this is called as the primary anisotropy). Later as the CMB traveled through space, it came into contact with objects and structures in the universe, which locally changes the CMB and imprints the data of cosmological objects into it (which component is called as the secondary anisotropy).

During the observations we measure the temperature fluctuations of this light in every direction from which we're able to create a temperature map. This map was first created using the data of the COBE space observatory and was announced in 1992 <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>. This was followed by the WMAP spacecraft in 2003 <a href="#cite2">[2]</a>, and later by the Planck mission in 2013 <a href="#cite3">[3]</a>.  
This temperature fluctuation could be explained by the universe having a primordial anisotropic structure that built up those fluctuations we observe in the CMB radiation. 

## III. Project goals
For this class, my project goals could be divided into two big sections. The first one involes the simulation of artificial CMB maps and the determination of their power spectrum with, and without the additional effects from the instrument and other sources. The second section of the project consist of the analysis of actual observational data. Particularly data from the Planck telescope, which can be freely accessed from the official site of the Planck mission in numerous different format. I'm also going to reverse engineer the power spectrum from this real dataset and compare it against the simulated one. This requires first to filter out the mentioned superimposed effects in the raw data as much as possible. Optionally I also intend to determine some of the cosmological parameters using the Planck observations if that is possible within the confines of this course.

## IV. Progression
The internet holds a wealth of information about both the computational and analytic side of the CMB research.
