This is the fourth and final report of the course Data Science Laboratory. Here I'm summarizing everything I've done during this course in detail and give some outlook on what other tasks can be done regarding this subject as a project work.
</b>

## I. Introduction
During the course I've been working on a project, which studied the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. In my [last report](/2020/11/11/cmb_report_3.html) I've already summarized in detail the programming side of this project work. This time I will give a general overlook on this subject about the tasks I've worked on, and outline some inspirational ideas about what other questions can be examined and researched in the context of this project.

The main goal was to learn some insight about how to simulate and how to analyze the CMB temperature anisotropy maps. In the first case I had to research and learn about the methods, which are usually used to simulate realistic maps of these temperature maps. Similarly, in the second task I've been ought to process real observational data and I had to look for and learn the methods that were needed to study true CMB temperature maps.


## II. Workflow and tasks
I started off the work by reading through the initial supplementary materials, which included a gentle introduction to the theoretical basics of the study of the CMB radiation <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>, the presentation slides from a lecture about a short introduction to the CMB radiation, held on the University of Oslo <a href="#cite2">[2]</a> and finally the most recent paper about the research of the Planck space observatory <a href="#cite3">[3]</a>. An extra source given were the presentation materials from the event called CMB Summer School 2019, which was organized by The McMahon Cosmology Laboratory <a href="#cite4">[4]</a>.

While the first three helped me to understand the theoretical basics of the CMB radiation, the latter one helped me by an enormous amount in learning the basic methods of the CMB simulations.
