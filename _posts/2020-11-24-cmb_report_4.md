This is the fourth and final report of the course Data Science Laboratory. Here I'm summarizing everything I've done during this course in detail and give some outlook on what other tasks can be done regarding this subject as a project work.

## I. Introduction
During the course I've worked on a project, where I studied the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. This phenomenon is an actively researched topic in astronomy, because it can provide us an enormous amount of information about cosmological parameters and the early state of the universe. By measuring the angular power spectrum of the CMB temperature anisotropy, we can tune parameters of the currently most widely accepted (standard) model of cosmology, the $\Lambda$CDM model. Measuring the CMB radiation can give us insight about numerous astrophysical objects too, as they leave traces and "shadows" on its temperature map. These objects can be eg. distant and dense galaxy clusters, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), Dust Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs), etc.

In my [second report](/2020/10/19/cmb_report_2.html) I gave a short overview on the history of the CMB research. Went into detail how the scientific consensus established slowly around the idea of the CMB being the remnant of the Big Bang and how it inspired the technological advancements in space exploration. In the past two and the half decades, three notable space observatories (COBE<a href="#cite1">[1]</a>, WMAP<a href="#cite2">[2]</a> and Planck<a href="#cite3">[3]</a>) were launched to gather unprecedented amount data about the CMB radiation and map the temperature anisotropy of the whole sky. The most recent one was the Planck space telescope, which provided us the most detailed and highest resolution datasets of the CMB radiation. In my project I also used these datasets.

In the [third report](/2020/11/11/cmb_report_3.html) I've already summarized in detail the programming aspects and progress of this project work. This time I will give a general overlook on the subject, talk about the tasks I've worked on, and outline some inspirational ideas about what other questions can be examined and researched in the context of this project. The main goal for me was to learn some insight about how to simulate and how to analyze CMB temperature anisotropy maps. In the first case I had to research and learn about the methods, which are usually used to simulate realistic images of these temperature maps and finally implement them. Similarly, in the second task I've been ought to process real observational data and I had to look for and learn the methods that were needed to study true CMB temperature maps and then analyze them.

## II. Overview of work flow
I started off the work by reading through the initial supplementary materials, which included a gentle introduction to the theoretical basics of the CMB radiation<a href="#cite4">[4]</a>, the presentation slides from a lecture about a short introduction to the CMB radiation, held on the University of Oslo<a href="#cite5">[5]</a> and finally the most recent paper about the research of the Planck space observatory. An extra source given were the presentation materials from the event called CMB Summer School 2019, which was organized by The McMahon Cosmology Laboratory<a href="#cite6">[6]</a> in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, written and organized by Jeff McMahon, Renee Hložek, Mat Madhavacheril, Sigurd Naess, and Alex Van Engelen. While the first three materials helped me to understand the theoretical basics of the CMB radiation, the latter one served as a perfect base to learn the methods of creating CMB simulations. It also gave an overview of the different astrophysical and cosmological components, which form the layers of a real image depicting the CMB radiation.

During the semester I've written two completely different pipelines for the simulation of CMB temperature anisotropy maps and one to load, process and analyze - true or generated - CMB data, which was encoded using the HEALPix spherical indexing standard<a href="#cite7">[7]</a>. One of the simulation methods was based on the materials from the mentioned CMB Summer School, while the other method utilized the built-in subroutines of the HEALPix library.

## III. Theoretical background
### III./1. Cosmological introduction
It is a well-known fact for science today that the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation is the remnant of the Big Bang in the form of heavily redshifted photons. The intensity of this black-body radiation is uniform throughout all directions on the sky and as our most recent measurements indicates, its average colour temperature is approximately $2.725$ K.

According to our current cosmological knowledge, the photons consisting the CMB radiation came to existence at the time of the Big Bang. The early universe was very hot and dense for hundreds of thousands years long since the Big Bang. Because of its excessive temperature, electrons existed only in an unbounded, free gas state and completely filled the early universe. This caused the existing photons to constantly scatter on particles in this electron gas and thus their mean free path was immensely short. Because of the constant scattering, photons and electron were also in thermal equilibrium. Since photons couldn't travel to long distances, the universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation at this point. As the universe expanded it slowly became more spares and colder. Approximately after $370\,000$ years, the universe cooled down enough (to $\approx 3000$ K), where the formation of hydrogen atoms was energetically favorable.

This period in the history of the universe is called as the "recombination era" or "decoupling". The electrons combined ("recombined") with the existing hydrogen nuclei and thus the photons "decoupled" from the matter, they stopped being in thermal equilibrium and was able to travel freely at virtually infinite distances without being constantly scattered and thus being "binded/coupled to matter". The term "recombined" refers to the now-defeated cosmological hypothesis that this event had already happened before, maybe numerous times. However physics still kept this original name to describe this era because of historical reasons, but now it's more appropriate to refer to this period as the "decoupling".

At this point the dense electron cloud filling the universe cleared up and photons scattered for the last time on free electrons. These photons are those, which we observe today as the CMB radiation itself. At the time of the last scattering the photons was the same temperature as the dissipated electron gas because of being on thermal equilibrium, but after that the CMB photons traveled practically without anything to cool them down. However the universe constantly expanded since then, and now because of this stretching, the CMB photons redshifted from their initial $3000$ K temperature the the currently measured $2.725$ K magnitude, which is equivalent to a redshift of $z \approx 1200$.

### III./2. Mathematical apparatus
As it was already mentioned, the CMB radiation is completely uniform in intensity in all directions on the sky. Because of this nature, the CMB photons may be considered to coming towards us from a very distant surface - where we are in the center -, which is usually referred to as the "Last Scattering Surface" (LSS). Photons travel at a finite speed, which means as time goes forward, this surface constantly expanding. First those photons reach our telescopes, which are the closest to us. But after some time $t$, farther photons will now had enough time to travel the distance between their positions at $t=0$ (the period of decoupling) and us. As time goes on, CMB photons reach us from farther and farther distances. This distance is - according to our best knowledge about the structure of the universe - is equal in every direction. It thus defines a spherical surface at any time $t>0$, which we can consider to be the origin of the currently observed CMB radiation, or as it called, the LSS.

The mathematical description of the CMB must have to build on this property. The general idea is to describe the observable quantities as a function over a spherical surface. Fortunately this problem arises in a lot of topics in physics and in mathematics and thus it was already described way before humanity reached to the point of photographing the CMB.

## IV. Accomplished tasks
### IV./1. Generation method 1. -- Using HEALPix
To maintain the consistency of my previous reports, I'm referring as "Generation method 1." to the simulation method involving the use of the HEALPix library, while referring as "Generation method 2." to the other one.

The two images on the left side were generated with $\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{beam}} = 3\,\mathrm{arcmin}$ and with $\sigma_{\mathrm{beam}} = 0.5\,\mathrm{arcmin}$, while the images on the right side were generated with parameters $\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{beam}} = 30\,\mathrm{arcmin}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{beam}} = 15\,\mathrm{arcmin}$. The effect of using a wider beam is clearly visible, as the images on the right side are much more "blurry".
