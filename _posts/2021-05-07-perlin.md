This project work was made for my course <i>"Modern Computational Methods in Physics 1"</i> at ELTE in the second term of the semester 2020-2021. I've implemented the "classic" Perlin noise generation algorithm and created a fractal noise map by stacking several Perlin noise maps on top of each other. I've interpreted the fractal map as a discrete force/displacement field and moved random particles on it by applying this well-defined force/displacement on them. I've also explored the "anatomy" of a Perlin noise simulation and created various visualizations of it.

## I. Introduction

Perlin noise is a type of <i>gradient noise</i> that was introduced and published by Ken Perlin in his paper <i>"An image synthesizer"</i> in 1985<a href="#cite1">[1]</a>. The noise function was further improved by Perlin in 2002, where he introduced the <i>"simplex noise"</i><a href="#cite2">[2]</a>. Perlin noise had a huge impact on the field of computer generation, graphics and visualization and it is still actively used in procedural texture and terrain generation today (see eg. Minecraft as the most popular example to this).

In this project I've reproduced the theoretical basics of the original, "classic" algorithm for 2D Perlin noise generation that I'll present in the following sections. The Perlin noise generation and particle tracing was implemented using modern `C++17`, while visualizations and data analysis was made using `Python 3.9`.


## II. Theoretical basics and construction of the Perlin noise

Perlin's both papers (from 1985 and 2002) and his provided code implementation were quite laconic. His uncommented and compacted example code only demonstrates the principle, while his papers are also short-spoken. However this topic can be much better understood when the individual steps are visually presented with a well-written description to them. That's why instead of a separate theoretical explanation and description of the technical aspects I'll present them together in the same section.

### II.1. Main and sub grid

The base structure of the classic Perlin noise consists of two overlapping grids of different grid sizes. The two grids are stretching between the same boundaries, while their edges overlap on each sides. An example of this can be seen on <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1.</a>, where both the main and the sub grid is shown. The grid points in the one I'm referring to as "main grid" are marked with bigger, white circles, with the nodes of the "sub grid" are marked with the smaller, brownish-yellow dots.

</div>

These grids are essentially define the frequency and the resolution of the Perlin noise. By increasing the number of vertices of the main grid, we're increasing the "frequency". By increasing the number of vertices in the sub grid, we're increasing the resolution.

Stacking noises of different frequencies, but identical resolutions creates what is called as "fractal noise".

### II.2. Generating a gradient field

The first step in the Perlin noise generation is to create a gradient field. The vertices of this field will coincide with the main grid points. In this step we have to place a gradient vector with randomly sampled argument into each main grid points. They will define our main gradient field. This component is visualized on <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2.</a>, where the gradient vectors are marked with red arrows. In my project the arguments of each gradient vectors are sampled from the uniform distribution.

</div>

### II.3. Calculating the dot product field
In the second step, first we calculate the distance vectors between the sub grid points and all corners of the cell they reside in. In 2D this would mean we're assigning 4 distance vectors for every sub grid points. Then the dot product of all distance vectors and their corresponding cell corners are calculated. This will leave us with 4 different "dot product maps", each of them corresponding to either one of the cell corners (upper left, upper right, etc.). On <a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3.</a> the dot product field corresponding to the upper right corners is shown.

### II.4. Interpolating the dot grids
After the $2^{D}$ (where $D$ is the dimension of the generated Perlin noise) dot product maps are obtained, we need to interpolate these maps to get the final Perlin noise field. This interpolation can be carried out by several different methods and one can use whatever method seems to be the most reasonable in that specific case. In Perlin noise implementations usually the Smoothstep interpolation method is used, and I've implemented its 5th order variant for my project too. The 5th order Smoothstep function that interpolates between two values is the following:

$$
i
=
\left( d_{1} - d_{0} \right) \cdot \left( \left( w \cdot \left( w \cdot 6.0 - 15.0 \right) + 10.0 \right) \cdot w^{3} \right) + d_{0}
$$

Since every pixel (sub grid vertex) has exactly 4 dot grid values assigned to it, the interpolation has to be carried out 3 times. First 2 times between two pairs of the 4 dot field values, then between the two resulted interpolation values.

  </label>
</div>

On <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4.</a> we can see an example image of the Perlin noise, which was directly obtained from the interpolation of the 4 dot fields we calculated. This map is what we call as Perlin noise. By that, the Perlin noise generation section is over.

## III. Flow field and particle tracing
The noise map defined a unique force field, that can be interpreted in physics as potential field, or even as a force field. In this field, particles can be moved by the force field, just like in a physical simulation. We can obtain this flow field directly from the Perlin noise map itself. The flow field corresponding to the upper examples can be seen on <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5.</a>

Particles driven in this field van be further analyzed. The goal of this project work was to obtain and visualize these particle trajectories in a creative manner. Results can be seen on <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6.</a>, <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7.</a> and <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8.</a>
